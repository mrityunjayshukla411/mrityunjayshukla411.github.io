I am a Phd Scholar at IIT Bombay in the CSE Department. The primary focus of my research is micro-architectural security and ML/DL security. I am working under [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) and [Prof. Sayandeep Saha](https://sites.google.com/view/sayandeepsaha/home).
